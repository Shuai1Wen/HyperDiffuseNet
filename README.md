In this work ,we use two 10X visium spatial tran data. These are mouse Mouse Olfactory Bulb data and PDAC data. The Mouse Olfactory Bulb data can be found in https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/adult-mouse-olfactory-bulb-1-standard-1.

The ST data of PDAC reported in this manuscript have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE111672.(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111672) We use the PDAC-A data under accession number GSE3036911 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM3036911)

If the PDAC data in this reposition is used in any publishable works, please citing:
